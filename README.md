# Conditional Logic Boilerplate plugin
Requirements for this plugin:

 - WordPress
 - Beaver Builder
 - Beaver Themer > 1.2

**About the plugin**
This is a wrapper for additional Conditional Logic for Beaver Themer. Hopefully the layout and in-file documentation are enough to get you started on developing additional logic and understand the inner workings.

It has everything you need, a demo rest route that you can tailor to your own needs and copy/build upon, and a demo filter called "ACME DEMO Filter" that will allow you to hide nodes based on a certain "Site Title" or the default-language the site is in.
